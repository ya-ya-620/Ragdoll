# Ragdoll Module

## Overview
The Ragdoll module is designed to enable ragdoll physics for characters in the game. It modifies the character's humanoid and motor constraints to create a more realistic falling and movement effect when the character is knocked down or falls.

## Features
- Transforms the character into a ragdoll state.
- Automatically manages the constraints and collisions of the character's parts.
- Restores the character to its original state when the ragdoll effect is removed.

## Usage
To use the Ragdoll module, you need to create an instance of the `RagDoll` class and pass the character model to it.
